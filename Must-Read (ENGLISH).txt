Hello, in this project I have shared with you the computers that need to be to meet the avionics requirements of a rocket flying at medium altitude (ground clearance 3km=9842.52 ft)
The modules I use are popular in rocket modeling Jul and you can get started!!! :)

I wanted to share a few little things with you about computers:

For the ROCKET COMPUTER
BMP280 sensor for temperature, pressure and altitude, MPU6050 as acceleration and gyroscope sensor, GPS-NEO7M for gps data, LORA E32 433T30D for ground communication data were used in this computer
The purpose of this computer is to provide continuous temperature, pressure, altitude, October, GPS data as of the rocket's location.

For the GROUND COMPUTER
Only LORA E32 433T30 was used in this computer to be able to read the data from the rocket computer and the mission computer.
The purpose of this computer is to transmit data from the mission and rocket computer on the airborne rocket to people.

For the MISSIONCOMPUTER
BMP280 sensor for temperature, pressure and altitude, CJMCU-811 sensor for air quality control (our mission is to measure air quality), GPS-NEO7M for gps data, LORA E32 433T30D for ground communication data were used in this computer.
The purpose of this computer is to measure the air quality and transmit it to the ground computer.

For the IGNITION COMPUTER
BMP280 sensor for temperature, pressure and altitude, MPU6050 is used as acceleration and gyroscope sensor in this computer.
The purpose of this computer is to send information for the parachutes to open when they fall from the maximum height.

I2C protocol for BMP280, MPU6050 and CJMCU-811 sensors
For the GPS-NEO 7M and LORA E32 433T30D, the UART protocol was used.

The project was made with Teensy 3.2 and Arduino nano(for the Ignition board)

This project belongs to the Ã‡ukurova Rocketry team, which is part of the 1.5 Adana Team.

If there is a place in the codes that you do not understand, you can get back to me. I'll try to answer it as soon as possible...
